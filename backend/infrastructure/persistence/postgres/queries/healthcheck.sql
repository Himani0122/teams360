-- Queries for HealthCheckRepository (backend/infrastructure/persistence/postgres/health_check_repository.go)
-- Moved verbatim from the hand-written SQL that lived inline in that file.
-- Do not hand-edit sqlcgen/*.go - regenerate with `sqlc generate` (see Makefile).

-- FindTeamHealthByManager and FindAggregatedDimensionsByManager each had two
-- runtime branches (with/without an assessmentPeriod filter) in the original
-- code. They are kept as two SEPARATE named queries here (not merged) so the
-- exact filter/behavior of each branch is preserved unchanged.
